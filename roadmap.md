# Roadmap
Here’s the plan, let’s see how it goes. I’m pretty sure it’s going to be coded in [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) with a dash of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) added later.

## Stage One (Pre-Code)

1. Sketch out a design.
2. Determine which features will make it into the first full release.

## Stage Two (Alpha)

*Currently too early to plan this stage.*

## Stage Three (Late Alpha)

*Currently too early to plan this stage.*

## Stage Four (Beta)

*Currently too early to plan this stage.*

## Stage Five (RC1)

*Currently too early to plan this stage.*

## Stage Six (GM)

*Currently too early to plan this stage.*
