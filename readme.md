# About V2

A [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) hand coded from the ground up in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), the Torch CMS is back and better than ever. Sporting a dashing new look, the next version of the Torch CMS (affectionately called *V2*) aims to fix previous issues and be more future-proof. This new version is completely new and shares no code with the previous version of the Torch CMS (V1).
