# About V2

Hand coded from the ground up in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) via [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), the Torch CMS is back and better than ever. Sporting a dashing new look, the next version of the Torch CMS (affectionately called *V2*) aims to fix many of the problems previously experienced. This new version is completely new and shares no code with the previous version of the Torch CMS.

## Roadmap

Do everything.
