# About V2

Hand coded from the ground up in [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) with a dash of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), the Torch CMS is back and better than ever. Sporting a dashing new look, the next version of the Torch CMS (affectionally called V2) aims to personify awesomeness. This new version is completely new and shares no code with the previous version of the Torch CMS.
